And not only that: the flair of “1001 Nights” also makes the zoo something special. When King Wilhelm I had the idea of building a bathhouse below Rosenstein Palace at the beginning of the 19th century, Wilhelma was born. The plan for the bathhouse quickly grew into a pleasure garden with pavilions, walkways, lakes and a banqueting hall. Everything was designed in the Moorish style, bringing a touch of “1001 Nights” to the Neckar. After the end of the monarchy, the royal pleasure garden was opened to the public as a botanical garden. However, the zoological history of Wilhelma only began after the Second World War with an aquarium show in 1949. Further exhibitions with living exhibits followed and after each show the wild animals remained at Wilhelma.",

With its rows of trees, fountains and fields of flowers, Schlossplatz is today considered one of the most beautiful squares in Europe. This was not always the case in the past. At the beginning of the 19th century, Schlossplatz was just a parade and drill ground. It was not until the 1860s that the dusty area was transformed into a blooming flower garden. The baroque garden with its intersecting paths and colorful flowers is a real jewel. There are the beautiful fountains, erected in honor of King William I in 1863, in which many a city dweller cools off on a hot day. There is the cast-iron bandstand with Moorish decorated arches, where military bands played every Sunday for many years.",
